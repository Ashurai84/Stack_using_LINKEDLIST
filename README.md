 # Stack Implementation Using Linked List in C++

## Description
This program demonstrates the implementation of a stack using a linked list in C++. The stack supports four primary operations:  
- **Push:** Adds an element to the top of the stack.  
- **Pop:** Removes the top element from the stack.  
- **Peek:** Returns the value of the top element without removing it.  
- **Display:** Prints all elements of the stack from top to bottom.  

## Functions
- `push(Node*& top, int value)`: Creates a new node with the given value, links it to the current top, and updates the top pointer.  
- `display(Node* top)`: Traverses and prints all elements of the stack.  
- `peek(Node* top)`: Displays the value of the top element without removing it.  
- `pop(Node*& top)`: Removes and deletes the top element of the stack.  

## Main Function
- Initializes an empty stack using a `Node*` pointer named `top`.  
- Uses `push()`, `display()`, `peek()`, and `pop()` to demonstrate stack operations.  

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/Ashurai84/Stack_using_LINKEDLIST>





   Stack elements: 30 20 10 
Top element: 30
Popped element: 30
